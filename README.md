## What is Caligrafy

Caligrafy is a new and modern MVC framework for PHP that was built from the ground up to provide easy and elegant ways for novice developers to build sophisticated and modern web applications. We've laid a solid foundation of security, social, e-commerce, analytics and machine learning features so that you focus your genius on your ideas. 

Caligrafy bridges the power of server-side languages like PHP with the sophistication of client-side languages like Javascript to expose you to how the most advanced Web capabilities are built.
